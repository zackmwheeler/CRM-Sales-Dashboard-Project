# CRM-Sales-Dashboard-Project

Here I created an interactive dashboard for Sales Managers to be able to track their team's quarterly performance.

Fist I looked at the 'sales_pipeline.csv' file and added the 'manager' and 'regional_office' columns from the 'sales_teams.csv' sheet.

This was done with a simple 'XLOOKUP' to find the corresponding 'manager' and 'regional_office' that was associated with the 'sales_agent'.
