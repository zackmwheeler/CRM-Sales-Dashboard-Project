## Here I created an interactive dashboard for Sales Managers to be able to track their team's quarterly performance.


### Step 1:

Fist I looked at the 'sales_pipeline.csv' file and added the 'manager' and 'regional_office' columns from the 'sales_teams.csv' sheet.

This was done with a simple 'XLOOKUP' to find the corresponding 'manager' and 'regional_office' that was associated with the 'sales_agent'.

### Step 2:

Next, I created a few pivot tables using the data.

#### First Pivot Table:

This one is used to show the opportunities won by quarter.

#### Second Pivot Table:

This one breaks down the percentage of won & lost opportunities by quarter.

#### Third Pivot Table:

This final pivot table shows the opportunities that are won by quarter for each sales agent.  It's set to go in descending order for opportunities won.

### Step 3:

This was the final step, where i created the dashboard. 

I created three charts as well as 2 filters.

#### First Chart:

The first chart was to show the numbers won for the most recent quarter.  It also compared the previous quarter.

#### Second Chart:

The second chart was a pie chart that showed the percentage of deals that were won.

As you can see I also greyed out the loss column to emphisize the wins over the losses. 

#### Third Chart:

This is the last chart, and it is a bar chart used to visualize opportunities won by each sales agent.

#### Added Filters:

Here I added two filters to be used. One for selecting the 'regional_office' and the other for 'manager'.

Final Product:
